This website project, titled “Agila Taekwondo Academy Website,” is purely fictional and was created for educational purposes only.

The gym featured on this website is not real. All information, layout, and content were developed as part of a school project to demonstrate website design, coding, and GitHub documentation skills.

The persons and images used in this project are not officially affiliated with any gym or organization named Agila Taekwondo Academy. Some individuals represented are real athletes and coaches from the Philippine sports community, including Mr. Keyence Natividad, who is a real strength and conditioning coach but not a Taekwondo player nor affiliated with the fictional academy. Their inclusion is solely for educational and illustrative purposes and does not imply any endorsement or association with this project.

Only Mr. Prince Gutierrez, the student developer, is an actual Taekwondo practitioner. However, he is part of a different real Taekwondo gym, which was not allowed to be used in this project. Therefore, the Agila Taekwondo Academy was created as a fictional representation for academic use while respecting privacy and ethical guidelines.
